                <h3 style=" background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;"> How to reverse aging, slow the
                    rate of aging, and become younger?</h3>
                <p>
                    The good news is that research suggests that environmental and lifestyle changes are the best way to
                    promote living healthier and longer. Genetics and biology do play a factor in age and life span,
                    however, it isn't as significant
                    and
                    lifestyle.
                    These lifestyle changes includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting adequate sleep</li>
                    <li> Eating nutrious meals</li>
                    <li> Keeping active throughout the day </li>
                    <li> Reducing stress and having proper ways to deal with stress</li>
                    <li> Having a Positive and Healthy Social Circle </li>
                </ul>

                Unfortunately, it isn't currently possible make yourself younger or revert your cells back to a younger
                state. There is a lot about the human body that is still unknown, but there is also a lot of investment
                in research to discover and explore the aging process and how to extend our life span and health span.

                <h3 style=" background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;"> What research is currently
                    being done on reversing aging? </h3>
                <p>
                    Tons of research is going into studying a variety of reasons as to why we age at the rate that we
                    do. Some facinating ones include research into senolytics
                    and the ability to address cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is when a cell has lost the
                    ability to replicate or die. These cells are considered to be harmful and can promote other cells to
                    also turn senecent as well. Removal of senecent cells is a major topic of addressing aging. There is
                    a supplement called Quercetin + Dasatinib
                    in phase I clinical trials that seems try and address this issue. <br>

                    One of the most facinating research studies being conducted is with stem cells and
                    transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation is the conversion of a cell type present in one tissue or
                    organ into a cell type from another tissue or organ without going through a pluripotent cell state
                    (stem cell state). An organism called the immortal jellyfish has this cellular mechanism which
                    allows them to return their cells to a younger state.
                    Research into Induced Pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) aims to do something similiar. Studies and
                    research have shown that skin and blood cells can be reprogrammed or reverted into younger states as
                    far as becoming a stem cell.
                    This process could provide easy and efficient access to stem cells which in turn could be used to
                    create cells that the body needs. This is a very interesting field as it serve as the foundation for
                    maintaining healthier cells for longer periods of time.
                    <br>
                    Telomere lengthing is also an aspect of aging that has been strongly researched with ways to
                    lengthen telomeres being published. One such method involves modified TERT mRNA that can lengthen
                    telomeres by 10%. This method is also considered temporary, thus creation of defective replicating
                    cells and cancer is lower, and treatments can be infrequent.
                    NAD+ supplements as well as other methods of reversing aging based on different theories of aging
                    are being explored daily. While much research is still needed to be done in order to unlock the
                    secrets of longer and healthier life, current research and theories offer a promising look into the
                    future and the direction of human aging.
