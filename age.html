                    Age and Aging are two intertwined concepts within the field of Gerontology and the study of Aging.
                    <br>
                    Age itself has two distinct defintions:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                        <li>Chronological Age: The age of a person as measured from birth to a given date</li>
                        <li>Biological Age: The age of a person's biology or body based on several biological markers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="fs-5"> The disinction between Chronological and Biological age is important because each
                    individuals
                    biology operates on its own timeline. Individuals age at different rates despite chronological age.
                    <br>
                    Another important distinction to make when discussing age and aging is the difference between Life
                    Span and
                    Health Span. Life Span is the length of time a person is alive, while Health Span is the length of
                    time a
                    person is generally in good health.
                    Health Span holds a very vague definition because what determines a person to be in good health
                    varies
                    between people and typically doesn't include acute illnesses.<br>

                    Aging also holds simliar distinctions, with chronological aging covering the process of aging over
                    time.
                    Biological Aging covers the aging process in relation to changes in biological markers over time.

                <h3 style=" background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;"> Why do we age? How does it
                    work? </h3>

                <p> It is generally agreed that aging occurs due to accumulation of cellular damage that leaves fewer
                    and less effective or healthy cells in the body over time.
                    However, there are currently over 300 theories related to and on aging and how it occurs. Many of
                    the theories overlap, and it maybe that aging occurs due to a combination of the these theories.
                    <br>

                    Most cells in the human body are ephemeral and have a short lifespan. Within the human body,
                    Eukaryotic cells follow the cellular cycle where the cell grows, copies its DNA, then divides itself
                    resulting in two cells total. It is believed that cells typically have a
                    limited number of times that they can divide and replicate due to accumulation of damage overtime.
                    Mutations also can occur that can cause more damage to the cell. More the most part once a cell
                    degrades to a certain point it has instruction to stop replicating and die off. Several theories try
                    and explain different reasons behind
                    cellular degradation and aging.
                    Theories:
                <ul>
                    <li>Programmed Theory: Organisms are preprogrammed to age and have a limited lifespan in order to
                        benefit future generations.</li>
                    <li>DNA Damage/Repair Theory: DNA damaged in the replication process that is unrepairable by the
                        human body contributes to accelerated aging via damaged cell creation.</li>
                    <li>Free Radical Theory: Mitochondria damage overtime leads to Reactive Oxygen Species leaking into
                        the body, which is harmful and can increase rates of aging.</li>
                    <li>Telomere Theory: Improper maintainence or shorterning of telomeres results in cellular senescene
                        and the breaking down of cell functions. </li>
                    <li>Senescence Cell Stress: The development and build up of senescence cells, cells that are damaged
                        and can't replicate or die. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Additionally, there are three types ways a cell can die or be recycled: apotosis, necrosis, and
                    authophagy<br>
                    Apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process in which internal or external cell signals
                    can trigger a cell to initiate this cellular death through enzymes spliting proteins within the
                    cell.
                    <br>
                    Necrosis is a form of cell injury that results in the premature death of cell. This type of cellular
                    death is typically unwanted.
                    <br>
                    Autophagy is the natural and conserved degradation or breaking down of cells to remove unecessary or
                    dysfunctional components and recycle cells. Nutrient starvation or fasting can possible trigger high
                    levels of autophagy in the body.
                    <br>
                    If any of the three types of cellular deaths are defective in the body, this can lead to more bad
                    cells staying within the body, replicating or harming unhealthy cells. This is another possible
                    reason for aging.
                    <br>
                    Overall, aging occurs because our body is continually fighting to maintain homeostatisis but
                    cellular damage continuously occurs that degrades our cells over time. There are multiple theories
                    around why we age and most focus on the different rates at which our cells age. It is generally
                    accepted that aging and degradation of cells is inevitable and most studies are focusing on life
                    span of healthy cells and how to extend it.

                <p> It is possible accelerate aging through increasing cellular stress. Those who engage in unhealthy
                    lifestyles for prolonged periods of time tend to exhibite accelerated age rates.
                    It is possible to slow the aging process as well. Avoiding cellular stress through healthy lifestyle
                    choices is a simple and easy way to do so. Drugs and other medicines are also actively being
                    researched to address aging and biologial malfunctions and defects.
